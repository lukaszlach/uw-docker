More than a million people died there.\nThe victims were overwhelmingly Jewish - but Poles, Roma and political prisoners were also murdered.\nINR head Jaroslaw Szarek said that the creation of the database, the only one of its kind in the world, marked a historic day.\nIt includes information about SS commanders and guards who worked at Auschwitz-Birkenau, their names, place and date of birth, nationality, military service and where possible, a photograph. \nThe information was gathered from Poland, Germany, Austria and the US. \nMr Szarek said it would help combat the wholly incorrect practice of referring to Auschwitz as a Polish-run camp.\nHe said the institute hoped to compile similar lists for other Nazi camps in occupied Poland.\nIn cases where a person has stood trial, judicial documents relating to the case are included with the documents. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paperwork relating to camp commander Rudolf Hoess - in charge of Auschwitz from 1940-43 - contains a photocopy of the death sentence he received from a Polish court in 1947.\nPoland has long complained that death camps are wrongly referred to as \"Polish\" because of misunderstandings surrounding their geographical location. \nThe new database is being made accessible in five languages and \"is a tool to fight lies\", Mr Szarek said. \n\"We're not expressing an opinion, we're presenting the cold, hard facts.\" \nSoviet forces entered Auschwitz on 27 January 1945.\nThe Nazis had abandoned the camp days earlier, leaving much of it intact."}
