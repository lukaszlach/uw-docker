The moment does not feel right for grand visions. \nThen there is the Polish government's anger at the re-election of their fellow-countryman Donald Tusk to a top job at the European Council. Poland - a huge beneficiary of EU funding - suddenly feels as though it might take the place in the European awkward squad that the UK is vacating.\n\nPoland is the  of EU funds - in 2015 it got \u20ac13.4bn (\u00a311.7bn; $14.2bn) from the EU.\nThe EU budget will come under huge strain when the UK - one of the biggest net contributors - leaves.\nThe dispute blew up after Poland failed to block the reappointment of Mr Tusk as European Council president - a key strategic role in the EU.\nAs a result Poland refused to give its consent for the joint statement at the end of the summit. Controversially, the conclusions - normally an expression of EU unity - .\nA long-running feud between him and Jaroslaw Kaczynski - the nationalist guiding the Polish government - caused the debacle.\nMr Tusk, a former Polish prime minister from a rival party, has been critical of controversial government policies, and has in turn been accused of meddling in Poland's domestic affairs.\nThere is new momentum behind the idea of EU members moving at different speeds - a way of saying that some member states are more in favour of further integration than others. \nFrance, Germany and Italy back it - but Poland is adamantly against.\nPoland and its neighbours fear being left behind if their stronger partners integrate in more areas, especially the eurozone.\nBut Mr Hollande said it was not about multi-speeds, but about being able \"to go faster... and also further without closing the door on anyone\".\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said different aspects of integration were \"open for every member state to take part in\".\nOver the years, the UK's distance from the EU on many key issues - including the euro, the Schengen passport-free zone and budget spending - has meant that the bloc is already de facto multi-speed.\nThere is a legal mechanism for smaller groups of countries to forge ahead with a common policy.\nThat was demonstrated again at this summit with agreement that 17 member states could set up a European Public Prosecutor's Office - seen as a way to combat VAT fraud."}
